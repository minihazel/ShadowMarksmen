# ShadowMarksmen

### Shadow Snipers!
This mod comes as a package to allow you to use a team of "shadow snipers," which will assist you with killing lights, small structures and even power lines both in the day and night. It comes equipped with sniper audio, timed shots, and a menu for choosing assistance type.

### Sniper types
- `Suppressed sniper shot` | A sniper will shoot whatever you're aiming at with a suppressed "sniper rifle."
- `Unsuppressed sniper shot` | A sniper will shoot whatever you're aiming at with an unsuppressed "sniper rifle."
- `Queued sniper shot` | A team of snipers will shoot a maximum of **5** shots at whatever you aimed and clicked on with suppressed "sniper rifles."

### Notes
`Queued sniper shot` is currently not implemented. There's no ETA for when it will be implemented.
